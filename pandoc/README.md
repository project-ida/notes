# Pandoc

This folder contains files necessary for [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) to convert the markdown files into Latex and PDF.

`default.latex` - this is the Latex template.

`refs.bib` - this is the Bibtex file that's used by Pandoc to generate references in the PDF and is referenced in the generated Latex file.

`ieee.csl` - this is the citation styles file that Pandoc uses to generate references in the PDF. It's not used for generating the Latex file.
