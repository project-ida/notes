# What is nucleonics?

Nucleonics is a scientific and engineering discipline that studies and applies the principles of physics to design, create, and operate devices that manipulate nucleons.

We take inspiration from the emergence of electronics that marked a fundamental shift in humanityâ€™s relationship to information. Underlying that shift was a revolution in the way we understood and interacted with electrons: rather than continuing to blow large aggregates of electrons through vacuum tubes, the transistor represented deliberate, precise control of electronic states.

What if, similar to our control of electronic states, we gained precise control of nuclear states?

Before we can think of the "what if?" it's essential to understand the "is it possible?".

Some of the essential physics of nucleonics (e.g. nuclear superradiance) was already proposed in [1965 by Terhune and Baldwin](https://doi.org/10.1103/physrevlett.14.589), but it's only in recent years that it's been possible to verify those ideas - see [Chumakov et.al 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-017-0001-z). We're now seeing increased interest and experimental progress in the controlling of nuclear states e.g.  [Bocklage et.al 2021](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abc3991) , [Heeg et.al 2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03276-x), and [Chai et.al 2025](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-024-02773-w). 

The answer seems to be yes - nucleonics is possible. Now to the question of "What if?".

# A vision for nucleonics

What if, similar to our control of electronic states, we gained precise control of nuclear states? We might imagine a world where nuclear radiation is a thing of the past or a world where we can increase nuclear fusion rates in solid states to technologically relevant levels. 

There are perhaps other visions for nucleonics, but if we take the above vision, then we can codify it into a mission statement.

> We want to enable rational engineering of small-scale devices fueled by clean nuclear energy

Now that we have a "destination", how are we going to get there?
