\section{What is nucleonics?}\label{what-is-nucleonics}

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Nucleonics is a scientific and engineering discipline that
studies and applies the principles of physics to design, create, and
operate devices that manipulate nucleons.}
\end{quote}

We take inspiration from the emergence of electronics that marked a
fundamental shift in humanity's relationship to information. Underlying
that shift was a revolution in the way we understood and interacted with
electrons: rather than continuing to blow large aggregates of electrons
through vacuum tubes, the transistor represented deliberate, precise
control of electronic states.

What if, similar to our control of electronic states, we gained precise
control of nuclear states? Before we can answer that question, it's
essential to first ask the ``Is it possible?'' question.

Some of the essential physics of nucleonics (e.g.~nuclear superradiance)
was already proposed in
\href{https://doi.org/10.1103/physrevlett.14.589}{1965 by Terhune and
Baldwin}, but it's only in recent years that it's been possible to
verify those ideas - see
\href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-017-0001-z}{Chumakov et.al
2017}. We're now seeing increased interest and experimental progress in
the controlling of nuclear states
e.g.~\href{https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abc3991}{Bocklage
et.al 2021} ,
\href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03276-x}{Heeg et.al
2021}, and
\href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-024-02773-w}{Chai et.al
2025}.

The answer seems to be yes - nucleonics is possible. Now to the question
of ``What if?''.

\section{A vision for nucleonics}\label{a-vision-for-nucleonics}

What if, similar to our control of electronic states, we gained precise
control of nuclear states? We might imagine a world where nuclear
radiation is a thing of the past or a world where we can increase
nuclear fusion rates in solid states to technologically relevant levels.

There are other possible visions for nucleonics, e.g.~one might take an
information technology angle relating to nuclear spintronics. However,
our vision takes an energy angle. We can recast the vision into a
``mission statement''

\begin{quote}
\textbf{We want to enable rational engineering of small-scale devices
fueled by clean nuclear energy}
\end{quote}

Now that we have a ``destination'', how are we going to get there? Are
there any potential roadblocks along the way? We need a roadmap.

\section{Nucleonics Roadmap}\label{nucleonics-roadmap}

To meet the vision, we need nucleonics to be more than possible, we need
it to be practical and so the essential question that a nucleonics
roadmap is answering is:

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Is nucleonics practical?}
\end{quote}

It may be that manipulating nuclear states for the purposes of energy
technology is sufficiently difficult to make it more of an academic
curiosity than an enabler of new technology.

From the energy perspective that our mission statement focusses on,
practicality means that we need to be able to:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Accelerate nuclear transitions by many orders of magnitude
\item
  Transfer nuclear energy from one type of nucleus to another
\item
  Control nuclear transitions with low frequency stimulation
\item
  Extract nuclear energy in benign forms
\end{itemize}

From a theoretical perspective, nucleonics does seem practical. In 2024,
\href{https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.08338}{Hagelstein et.al} showed for the
first time that known quantum physics principles could be applied to
satisfy the above criteria and moreover explain long standing
experimental nuclear anomalies found in LENR experiments.

Hagelstein's theoretical framework relies on combining several pieces of
well established quantum physics in a novel way. The central question is
whether Mother Nature respects this novel combination. The framework
needs to be stress tested in several carefully designed experiments in
order to pass the ultimate litmus test.

\subsection{Accelerating nuclear transitions by many orders of
magnitude}\label{accelerating-nuclear-transitions-by-many-orders-of-magnitude}

One of the key bit of physics responsible for accelerating nuclear
transitions is Dicke Superradiance. First proposed by
\href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRev.93.99}{Dicke in the 1950s} for
atoms and then extended by
\href{https://doi.org/10.1103/physrevlett.14.589}{Terhune and Baldwin in
the 1960s} for nuclei, Dicke's model showed that \(N\) particles can
radiate/decay collectively up to \(N^2\) faster that an individual
particle. In a solid lattice, the number density is
\(\sim 10^{28} \ \rm m^{-3}\) and so Dicke enhancements can in principle
be extremely large.

The challenge for nuclear superradaince is how close the nuclei need to
be for collective emission to occur. Dicke's model is based on all \(N\)
nuclei being coupled together through an interaction with a common
oscillating field. In order to get the full \(N^2\) enhancement, all the
nuclei need to be located within a single wavelength of one other. The
wavelength is determined by the frequency (and hence energy) of the
field oscillations. Typically the frequency is chosen to be matched to
the nuclear transitions which mostly have energies of
\(E > 10 \ \rm keV\) and wavelengths of \(\lambda < 0.1 \ \rm nm\). In a
typical solid lattice you can fit at most one particle in cube whose
sides are given by such a small wavelength.
\href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-017-0001-z}{Chumakov et.al
2017} achieved small levels of nuclear superradiance (\(\sim 10 \times\)
rate enhancements) in \(\rm ^{57}Fe\) experiments because of this.

Much larger Dicke enhancement rates are required for practical
applications. Bridging the rate enhancement gap can in principle be
achieved by choosing a low frequency (and hence long wavelength) that's
mismatched with respect to the nuclear transitions. In such a set-up, a
nucleus radiates a number of smaller energy oscillator quanta instead of
a single large one. The challenge with this approach is that the more
quanta that are involved, the slower the process becomes - this can
dominate over Dicke enhancements depending on the specific details.

There is a novelty in demonstrating Dicke enhancements with oscillator
and nuclei that are mismatched. It would therefore be preferable to
separate that novelty from the specific demonstration of extremely large
nuclear Dicke enhancements. One way to do this is to repeat the Chumakov
experiment but instead of using \(\rm ^{57}Fe\) we use
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotopes_of_thorium\#Thorium-229m}{\(\rm ^{229m}Th\)}.

\(\rm ^{229}Th\) has a nuclear isomer \(\rm ^{229m}Th\) whose existence
was hypothesised for many years but
\href{https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjs/s11734-024-01098-2}{was
only nailed down in 2024}. \(\rm ^{229m}Th\) is unique in that it has an
extremely low energy nuclear transition energy of \(8.36 \ \rm eV\)
which corresponds to a wavelength of \(148 \ \rm nm\). A cube of this
size would contain about \(3\times 10^7\) nuclei at typical solid
density - more than enough to observe some very large Dicke
enhancements.

The specifics of \(\rm ^{229m}Th\) require us to arrange the system to:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Maximise radiative decay over internal conversion

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Excite half of the \(\rm ^{229m}Th\) nuclei instead of all of them
    will give us \(N^2\) enhancement of radiation and only \(N/2\)
    enhancement of internal conversion
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Minimise the reflection of the UV laser light from the surface

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Embed the \(\rm ^{229m}Th\) into an UV transparent material
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
