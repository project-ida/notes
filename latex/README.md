# Latex files 

This folder contains Latex files create from the corresponding markdown file in the root of the repository.

The Latex files have been automatically generated using [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) using Github Actions (see the [workflow file](/.github/workflows/convert-from-markdown.yml) for more details).

The contents of these files can be taken and used in a Latex editor like [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) where you can continue editing. You'll just need to remember to take the [refs.bib](/pandoc/refs.bib) file with you.
